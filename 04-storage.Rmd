# Storage {#storage}
In this chapter we will show you how to use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) ([https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/)).

## Create an S3 bucket
On S3, objects (data and their metadata) are stored in buckets. RosettaHUB calls these buckets **Simple Storage Drives** and provides a default bucket for each user.

```{r storageS3DriveSection, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Simple storage drive section on Federation console"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/storage_simple_storage_drives_section.png")
```

Let's create a new bucket (simple storage drive) to use on this course. Go to the simple storage drive section on the Federation console and click create.
```{r storageCreateS3Storage, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Create S3 storage dialog box"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/create_s3_storage.png")
```

Specify a **Label** and **Bucket**. Accept defaults for all other settings. The **Bucket** name must be globally unique ([https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html)), so here we have combined our username (bioinfo1.cam) with the RosettaHUB domain name:

**Label**: *course*

**Bucket**: *com-rosettahub-course-bioinfo1.cam*


```{r storageCreateS3StorageCompletedForm, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Set Label and Bucket names"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/create_s3_storage_form_completed.png")
```

Once your new simple storage drive has been created, it will be listed alongside your default storage drive.
```{r storageS3course, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="New S3 bucket has been added to list of simple storage drives."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/simple_storage_drives_incl_course.png")
```

Left clicking on the new bucket (simple storage drive) will take you to the AWS management console. Try uploading a file.
```{r storageS3BucketWebInterface, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="S3 bucket web interface."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/s3_bucket_web_interface.png")
```
