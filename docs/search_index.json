In this course we will show you how cloud computing can be used to meet the challenges of storage, management and analysis of big data. The first half of the course will introduce cloud infrastructure technologies. The second half will cover tools for collaborative working, resource management, and creation of workflows. The instructors will demonstrate how they are using cloud computing in their own research. N.B. If you sign up for this course, you will be automatically registered for an AWS educate account, which will provide you with sufficient AWS credits to complete the course exercises. If you decide to continue using cloud computing after the course, you will need to either purchase more credits or apply for a grant from programs like: AWS Cloud Credits for Research, Microsoft Azure for Research or Google Cloud Platform Education Grants. After this course you should be able to: Launch a virtual machine Build and deploy Docker containers Configure storage Create data analysis workflows Analyse your own data in the cloud During this course you will learn about: Cloud infrastructure technologies Using containers for reproducible research Collaborating in the cloud Managing cloud resources The hierarchy of cloud services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS). 1.2 Registration Bioinformatics Training: Big Data and Cloud Computing 1.3 Prerequisites Familiarity with Linux/Unix would be helpful, but not essential 1.4 Github bioinformatics-training/big-data-cloud 1.5 License GPL-3 1.6 Contact If you have any comments, questions or suggestions about the material, please contact the course instructors: Sudhakaran Prabakaran, and Matt Wayland. 1.7 Colophon This book was produced using the bookdown package (Xie 2017), which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).
