In this course we will show you how cloud computing can be used to meet the challenges of storage, management and analysis of big data. The first half of the course will introduce cloud infrastructure technologies. The second half will cover tools for collaborative working, resource management, and creation of workflows. The instructors will demonstrate how they are using cloud computing in their own research. N.B. If you sign up for this course, you will be automatically registered for an AWS educate account, which will provide you with sufficient AWS credits to complete the course exercises. If you decide to continue using cloud computing after the course, you will need to either purchase more credits or apply for a grant from programs like: AWS Cloud Credits for Research, Microsoft Azure for Research or Google Cloud Platform Education Grants. After this course you should be able to: Launch a virtual machine Build and deploy Docker containers Configure storage Create data analysis workflows Analyse your own data in the cloud During this course you will learn about: Cloud infrastructure technologies Using containers for reproducible research Collaborating in the cloud Managing cloud resources The hierarchy of cloud services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS). 1.2 Registration Bioinformatics Training: Big Data and Cloud Computing 1.3 Prerequisites Familiarity with Linux/Unix would be helpful, but not essential 1.4 Github bioinformatics-training/big-data-cloud 1.5 License GPL-3 1.6 Contact If you have any comments, questions or suggestions about the material, please contact the course instructors: Sudhakaran Prabakaran, and Matt Wayland. 1.7 Colophon This book was produced using the bookdown package (Xie 2017), which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).

An Image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime. An image typically contains a union of layered filesystems stacked on top of each other. An image does not have state and it never changes. A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A Docker container consists of A Docker image An execution environment A standard set of instructions The concept is borrowed from Shipping Containers, which define a standard to ship goods globally. Docker defines a standard to ship software. 4.2 Images on RosettaHUB RosettaHUB provides two types of images: Managed images: These are images that are created and maintained by RosettaHUB or images that are derived from these images. RosettaHUB currently provides two managed images (CPU-Docker RH Workbench and GPU-Nvidia-Docker RH Workbench) which are equipped with a range of tools (Jupyter, Zeppelin, RStudio and RosettaHUB workbench) to facilitate data science and have a user friendly desktop environment. Semi-managed images: These are images that map AMIs on AWS that are not derived from RosettaHUB images. Semi-managed images allow users to easily launch a machine from the RosettaHUB web console using their RosettaHUB keys. Access to the instances is managed by RosettaHUB, ie RosettaHUB generates and saves the private keys associated with the machine and allows you to retrieve any time the credentials to connect your machine using RDP for Windows instances or Ssh for Linux instances. 4.3 Launch a container "],

The process is as follows: launch a RosettaHUB machine install additional software and/or make configuration changes create a new image from the modified machine In Docker terminology, we add a layer to the base image. For some projects we do not want the overhead of a graphical user interface and do not require all of the tools provided by the managed To create a derived managed image, users have to launch a RosettaHUB machine then create an image from that machine on RosettaHUB. Managed images are configured with Docker containers. Docker containers contain applications for data science such as Pyhton, R, Rstudio, Scala, Sql and notebooks such as Jupyter and Zeppelin. We can create derived images from any of these baseline images. Explain example 6.2 Launch machine On Federation Console, go to Images section where you will see the following list: Right click on Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS and select ‘Launch’ from the context menu.
